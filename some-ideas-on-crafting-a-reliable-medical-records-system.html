        <p>So let me set the scene here: you're a busy hospital intern
on your night shift, with a backlog of several patients to
tend to. You also have several new patients to take histories
of and order treatments for. Adding to all that are those
daily patient notes you were too busy to write; the ones you
did manage to write were all done from different computers.
You glance at your stone-cold box dinner and sigh. Suddenly the
computerized medical record and order system breaks down, and you
are forced to put off writing your notes. You give your
orders via good old pen and paper.</p>
<p>This is not a daily occurence, but we should pause and think a bit
about some architectural choices made here and some alternatives.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Centralized patient records</p>
<p>Centralized control of patient records offers several benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Better privacy (in theory)</p>
<p>In a centralized model, patient records are not easily distributed
outside of the terminals that have been granted access to this data,
and thus the patient enjoys better privacy. In theory. The reality is
that if hospital terminals are not sufficiently secured against outside
adversaries, patient data may still be leaked. The practice of BYOD in
many hospitals only adds to this uncertainty.</p>
<p>A solution may be to enforce strict separation between the hospital
intranet and the external network, forcing users to choose between
the two whenever they attempt a connection. This still doesn't prevent
malware (especially spyware) on the user end, and doesn't prevent a
malicious user from copying the patient data for other uses (a la DRM).
However, a centralized approach will at least be able to provide an
audit trail in case of inappropriate access to patient data. In
contrast, access control may be an issue on distributed systems. For
example, the distributed version control system Git does not provide
a built-in mechanism for access control, rendering it unsuitable for
keeping medical records without serious hacking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data consistency and version control</p>
<p>Consistency is crucial in patient records: imagine if multiple doses
of a drug were given but only one dose was recorded, or vice versa,
as a result of medical records being made from different terminals.
Or another extremely common scenario: a physician leaves their half-written
note to check on another patient, then continues to type their note on
another computer. The possibility of data inconsistency now emerges
(although most likely the physician would save his incomplete note
before leaving). Note that the consistency being dicussed here is different
from the consistency talked about in database design.</p>
<p>Consistency can be achieved in a number of ways, the most common of
which is provided by version control systems using locking. The idea is
that the user acquires a lock from the central server, makes edits, then
relinquishes the lock once the editing session has ended. Most version
control systems do not have a timeout on the file lock by default; this can
be problematic if a user logs in then leaves the terminal to do something
else, while another user needs to make edits to this particular file in
the meantime. A timeout on the lock combined with autosave could help
avoid messes like lock-breaking and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Another benefit of a centralized medical record system is the simplified
version control scheme. In a distributed version control system such as
Git, each user gets a copy of the current project files, then creates
branches to work on; branches are created and merged with high frequency.
While this setup is ideal for distributed programming, it can be
problematic in a hospital environment: only one version of the patient
history is valid, and usually there is only one file involved for each
patient, rendering moot the idea of concurrent work. If we assume that all
patient history files are stored in one repository, then a distributed
version control system such as Git will need to mirror the entire repository;
that is, every file on every patient will need to be copied to every terminal.
This is hardly practical.</p>
<p>The main drawback of using a centralized system is the single point of
failure. If the system is taken down (intentionally or not; for example,
due to a power failure or maintenance), nobody will be able to edit patient notes.
A way around this is to design the client such that notes are stored locally
if the server is detected to be offline (perhaps with some type of heartbeat
protocol), then syncronization is done once the server is back online. The
models of many existing file synchronization services may provide
valuable insight. However, one should note that the problem of conflict
resolution may be tricky to solve in the absence of a file locking mechanism;
if a lock is not made before the server is brought down, the resulting conflicts
may require some communication on the part of the users. Hopefully this will
be a rare occurence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centralized medical order system</p>
<p>In contrast to the nature of patient notes, medical orders must be precise
and sequential. For example, a blood culture order must come before the
use of IV antibiotics. This requires that a locking mechanism be used, and
renders the idea of a decentralized system infeasible.</p>
<p>The burden of ensuring that orders are sequential and complete currently
falls on the nursing staff. One method of aiding in this task is to create
order 'packages' and a warning mechanism if orders are incomplete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patient notes</p>
<p>Patient notes form the core of the medical record. Each note should
reflect the observations and thinking processes of the physician. However,
as it happens, some notes regarding several types of patients consist of
little more than modified boilerplate. Thus the logical next step is to
create a mechanism to generate this note. Several circumstances under
which notes may be generated using a template system with minimal
individualization are notes documenting normal neonates, chemotherapy
patients, and women undergoing labor. Well-written templates may also
be applied to patients with common infections, as well as patients
undergoing scheduled elective surgery.</p>
<p>There are many ways of generating text from a template. Some ideas
include using simple text substitution (e.g., <code>str.format</code> in Python 3),
macros (e.g., GNU M4), stream editors (e.g., sed), template engines
(e.g., Django Template Language and Jinja), and a multitude of others.
However, the requirement of being able to pull data from a remote server
as well as conditional statements and logic must be taken into account.
Templates must also be simple enough for non-programmers to create.</p>
<p>The choice of format must also be considered. At NCKUH, the record
system is built around the Microsoft Word format (DOC): while temporarily
saved notes are stored in the system (presumably as raw text), official
saving requires the terminal to have a recent version of Microsoft Word
installed, to generate the document itself. Using the Word format offers
multiple advantages, including a built-in revision history, comments,
spelling and grammar checks, and more. Disadvantages include vendor lock-in,
and the inability of devices without Microsoft Word installed to perform
official saving.</p>
<p>An alternative being considered here is HTML5. It is an open standard, and may
contain links to other relevant documents such as lab results. Reflow works
across many devices, as it is pure text (images may be embedded in-line
if necessary). Another option is OpenDocument Text (ODT); this format offers
many of the same advantages as Microsoft Word, but is an open standard. Like
DOC and unlike HTML5, this format is more difficult to work with using standard
text-processing tools. In any case, if a medical record system really were built
using some Web framework, then HTML5 is the logical choice here. For a real-world
example, see the system employed at NTUH using Web forms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we're done with what exists right now, let's move on to what's
possible:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Automated creation of individual patient physiological models</p>
<p>Human physiology can be extremely complicated and difficult to
understand; just ask any medical student. The field of mathematical
physiology attempts to re-create various aspects of human physiology
using knowledge gained from various fields such as statistical
mechanics and physical chemistry. The Biogears project, among many others,
aims to produce an accurate model of the human body in this way.
Unfortunately, while these mathematical models may be quite accurate in
describing the general behavior of such physiological systems in a given
population, various tweaks need to be done and parameters added to these
models in order to predict more accurately the patient's outcome as well as
effects of treatment. We could in theory craft a system capable of generating
individualized physiological models based on past behaviors and reactions.
Such a system would need access to the patient's medical history, therapeutic history,
lab measurements, and results of physical exams. A standardized, machine-friendly
way of representing these bodies of knowledge would prove to be highly valuable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augmented medical decision-making</p>
<p>Expert systems designed to assist medical workers in making decisions have
existed for several decades, including the famous MYCIN, which attempted to
give advice on suitable antibiotic use. Since then, there have been attempts
to create languages and standards specifically geared to encoding medical
logic, one of which is the Arden syntax. It is conceivable that a hybrid
system utilizing both 'crystallized knowledge', or codified medical logic,
and 'fluid knowledge', or generalizations derived by machine learning
processes, and given access to machine-readable representations of patient
state, will be able to provide highly reliable medical advice and reduce
the cognitive load on the medical worker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no doubt that as technology progresses many more unforeseen uses will
be found for the electronic medical record. The point is, I believe the time is ripe
for a fresh attempt at designing a medical record system that is future-proof,
and this field of software design is abound with many exciting opportunities.</p>
