        <p>One of the things I learned about while working as our department's semi-official sysadmin back in medical school was the FreeBSD operating system, which our file server happened to run on (FreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE, with MapleBBS and ProFTPD). I got a copy of Michael W. Lucas's excellent book <em>Absolute FreeBSD, 2nd edition</em>, and got to work securing and tweaking our server. I'd been running Ubuntu for several years, and was fascinated by how well laid out and designed FreeBSD was. Over the next several years I'd entertained the idea of switching entirely to FreeBSD, but dual-booting wasn't so well-supported back then, meaning I probably had to get a new drive to experiment if I wanted it on bare metal. (All the major Linux distros supported dual-booting, but the FreeBSD installer couldn't handle that back then; as I understood it they actually needed Grub to do that.)</p>
<p>I put the idea on hold until a few months ago when I bought a new SSD for my laptop (a Thinkpad E550); this was a great excuse/opportunity to start everything from scratch. I had tried out PC-BSD (now called TrueOS) in a VirtualBox VM, which worked...kind of. The Lumina desktop environment was kind of buggy, and its AppCafe app store only had limited options (I may be biased here, since I've used and loved Synaptic for years). Then PC-BSD became TrueOS, which apparently spun off its Lumina project to form Project Trident. Then I moved on to GhostBSD, but the VESA driver that came with it didn't support my Full HD screen resolution, leading to difficulties even installing it. Eventually I gave up on these pre-built distros and decided to start from a base FreeBSD installation and work from there. This is a record of this journey, and I hope this can serve as a guide to whomever wants to set up their laptop to run a FreeBSD desktop.</p>
<p>For the most part I followed the (very detailed) tutorial hosted at <a href="https://trihexagonal.org/tutorial.html">Trihexagonal</a>, with some of my own tweaks thrown in. Again, I'm doing this on a Thinkpad E550 with a brand-new (i.e., non-partitioned) SSD, so here goes.</p>
<p>(Note that this is a work in progress, and is incomplete; see "Open issues" at the end.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the base FreeBSD system according to the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keymap: I chose the default keymap (US). This works with input methods which use bopomofo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partitioning: I chose auto ZFS and set disk encryption to yes. This will set up whole disk encryption with GELI; you will need the passphrase at boot time later on. Since I've got only one disk I've set the pool type to 'stripe' and set the number of disks to one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network configuration: I've set up the wireless interface. I've set the country to 'Taiwan' and the regulatory rules to 'FCC4'. I've also set the resolver to 1.1.1.1, which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1.1.1.1">resolver</a> operated by Cloudflare/APNIC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Startup services: I enabled sshd, moused, ntpd, and powerd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System hardening: I enabled 'Randomize the PID for newly created processes' and 'Disallow Dtrace destructive-mode'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot and setup the pf firewall according to the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup root .cshrc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not change the pager to 'more', as I'm more familiar with and prefer 'less' over 'more' (since it allows you to scroll backwards).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot and take note of how to enter single-user mode to fix rc.conf if you happen to screw it up (fortunately this did not happen during my install).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diable the system bell by adding the line 'kern.vt.enable_bell=0' to sysctl.conf. Seriously, that thing is loud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fetch and install the system updates and the Ports tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install portmaster (ports-mgmt/portmaster).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may want to skip the part about installing mc, it's up to you (personally I never used it much afterwards).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install X.org (x11/xorg).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I installed the VESA driver (which doesn't support Full HD). The Thinkpad E550 has a combination of AMD Radeon R7 M260 and Intel integrated graphics on a Core i5 5200U; you can choose only one at boot time to run (unlike, say, Nvidia with Intel integrated graphics on Linux, where you can use <a href="https://bumblebee-project.org">Bumblebee</a> to switch between the two at runtime). Intel integrated graphics for this CPU version is not supported by the X.org builtins. You need to install the port graphics/drm-next-kmod (or perhaps the newer and more up-to-date graphics/drm-current-kmod) in order to get graphics running at the correct resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also installed the Synaptics driver for X.org (x11-drivers/xf86-input-synaptics), but support for the Thinkpad's touchpad is still spotty (specifically the right mouse button is a bit wonky). USB mouse works without issues though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot and install Xfce4 (x11/xfce4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fluxbox is very lightweight and configurable (and I really ought to learn it one of these days), but Xfce4 is something I've known and loved (probably second only to KDE, at least before Systemd got its grubby hands all over it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the Xfce4 goodies (x11/xfce4-goodies).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This port provides some really nice stuff like desktop applets, a wireless connection manager, and a battery monitor (a must for any laptop).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may want to consider <em>not</em> installing stuff related to PulseAudio. It's not a bad technical choice per se, but I consider PulseAudio kind of bloated, especially when alternatives live Sndio are available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install xfe (x11-fm/xfe), Leafpad (editors/leafpad), and Eterm (x11/eterm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can skip these if you prefer the utilities in the xfce4 goodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable dbus and hald in rc.conf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the .xinitrc file for your user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Xfce4 the file simply contains the line 'exec startxfce4'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point you can try running startx to see if Xfce4 works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the devfs rules and enable devd according to the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup proper pf rules according to the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reboot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not edit the /etc/ttys file, just in case I lost the root password and needed single-user mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not delete the toor user, though I probably should.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit /etc/rc.conf according to the tutorial and reboot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the NTFS-3G drivers (sysutils/fusefs-ntfs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many USB flash disks are NTFS-formatted these days (at least, more common than ones using exFAT, in which case you want sysutils/fusefs-exfat).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable fuse in rc.conf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install programs you commonly use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I installed Firefox (www/firefox) and LibreOffice (editors/libreoffice), both of which can take overnight to compile (Firefox needs Rust and LibreOffice needs the JDK).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Open issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can consider the use of a display manager. Currently X.org needs to be started from the command line (with startx).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently no way of umounting drives as non-root user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The EFI partition appears on the desktop twice, cause currently unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic switching between speaker and audio jack output doesn't work yet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
