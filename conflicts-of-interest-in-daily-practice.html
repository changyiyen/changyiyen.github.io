        <p>Some time ago I watched an episode of John Oliver's Last Week Tonight in which he discussed the bias in medicine, specifically medicine as practiced in the United States. The piece was interesting because it gave a glimpse into what external, non-medical factors go into making these medical decisions, as well as the implications for patients. I thought it may be beneficial, as somebody just starting a medical career in Taiwan, to compare the differences between the medical cultures of these two countries.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed is, whenever a speaker from the United States (and, to a lesser extent, European countries) is invited to speak in Taiwan, conflicts of interest, such as affiliations or positions within the pharmaceutical industry, are almost always listed on the second or third slides of the presentation itself. That indicates quite clearly to everyone that what is about to be presented may be distorted or biased to a certain extent. In contrast, it's relatively rare for a Taiwanese presenter to first declare conflicts of interest. A common scenario would be for a pharmaceutical company to treat physicians to a meal, and have somebody (whether a sales representative or a physician) do a presentation on a disease for which the company is marketing a drug, along with presentation of materials relating to the drug itself. This is basically what Oliver's been warning viewers in the United States about: improper relations between the pharmaceutical company and the doctor.</p>
<p>However, one key difference exists between the United States and Taiwan: the National Health Insurance program, which, depending on who you ask, is both a blessing and a curse. The National Health Insurance program covers nearly everybody living here (including permanent residents), and is the main source of income for most medical facilities in Taiwan. The National Health Insurance bureau has, for years, slashed the cost of drugs and treatments under its program, to such an extent that many brand-name generics have been withdrawn, since the profit margin is minuscule to nonexistent. One infamous example is the withdrawal of benzathine penicillin, which nearly nobody uses anymore to treat general infections but is still needed to treat syphilis; one would need to apply to the NHI for reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. In the United States, health insurance is mostly covered by private insurers (excluding people covered under the Affordable Care Act). In addition, pharmaceutical companies are allowed to market prescription-only drugs directly to patients, which as one can imagine, can greatly strain doctor-patient relations.</p>
<p>So we have an interesting situation in Taiwan: healthcare professionals have little incentive to declare conflicts of interest, partly because whichever choice the patient makes, it will be the National Health Insurance program that makes sure that doctors get paid (mostly). On the other hand, the relation between doctor and patient in the United States appears much more commercial in nature, and healthcare professionals have more of an obligation to declare conflics of interest. This is just my observation, and I would be interested in seeing observations from other countries with national health insurance programs.</p>
